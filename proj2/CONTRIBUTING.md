# Contributing to ByteBite

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ByteBite. This document outlines the development workflow and expectations for contributions.

The project is maintained by NCSU Team G25 and is primarily used for academic and research purposes. Contributions should preserve the single-restaurant model and the focus on food redistribution.

## Repository Layout

- `backend/`: Node.js + Express API, MongoDB data models.
- `frontend/`: React + Vite customer-facing application (including 3D menu views).
- `admin/`: React + Vite dashboard for restaurant staff.

Contributors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with all three components, but focused contributions (for example, backend only) are perfectly acceptable.
